Welcome to the main page of the Axon Address Book Sample.

With this sample we want to show the basic features of the Axon framework. We show these features using multiple different client side applications.

We have a flex client, a spring mvc client, a REST client and the start of a Vaadin client. The REST client is used in a node.js sample that can be found in another repository.
